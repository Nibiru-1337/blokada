- Having a problem with a particular app? Maybe we know already, check http://go.blokada.org/issue_app
- Blokada not working at all? Maybe your device has known issues, check http://go.blokada.org/issue_device
- Reporting a bug? Your title must answer a question "What does not work for you?" (example: "Blokada randomly closes after few days", but not, "It doesn't work"). Also make sure you follow the rest of the template and provide complete information.
